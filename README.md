# virtuals-backend

this is backend of the project so to use this just clone the project and run these commands :- 


```npm install```

```npm run dev```

And make an env file and make a JWT_SECRET and your OPENAI_API_KEY in it

after that just you can just use all the APIs present in it You can see all the APIs in postman.json to use that just go to Postman, and import a new collection and then paste the postman.json in it and then you can use all the APIs in postman or you can use them some where else too.

I am working on frontend of this project and it will be live soon to try out too
